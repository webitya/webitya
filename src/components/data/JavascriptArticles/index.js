    content: `
      <p>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) marked a significant turning point for JavaScript, introducing a wealth of new features that made the language more powerful, expressive, and enjoyable to write. Subsequent ES versions have continued this trend, bringing even more enhancements.</p>
      <h2>Key ES6+ Features</h2>
      <p>Here are some of the most impactful features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arrow Functions:</strong> A more concise syntax for writing function expressions, with lexical <code>this</code> binding.</li>
        <li><strong><code>let</code> and <code>const</code>:</strong> Block-scoped variable declarations that address common issues with <code>var</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Template Literals:</strong> Easy string interpolation and multi-line strings using backticks.</li>
        <li><strong>Destructuring Assignment:</strong> A convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread and Rest Operators:</strong> Powerful syntax for expanding iterables and collecting arguments into an array.</li>
        <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, making object-oriented programming more familiar.</li>
        <li><strong>Modules (<code>import</code>/<code>export</code>):</strong> Native support for modularizing JavaScript code, improving organization and reusability.</li>
        <li><strong>Promises:</strong> A cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations, leading to more readable code than traditional callbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Async/Await:</strong> Built on Promises, this syntax makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, greatly improving readability and error handling.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why Master ES6+?</h2>
      <p>Adopting ES6+ features is crucial for modern JavaScript development. It leads to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaner and more readable code.</li>
        <li>Reduced boilerplate.</li>
        <li>Better handling of asynchronous operations.</li>
        <li>Improved maintainability and scalability of applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Staying updated with the latest JavaScript standards is key for any aspiring or experienced web developer.</p>
