    content: `
      <p>The Next.js App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, represents a significant shift in how we build web applications with React. It brings powerful new features like Server Components, nested layouts, and advanced data fetching capabilities, enabling developers to create highly performant and scalable applications.</p>
      <h2>Key Concepts of the App Router</h2>
      <p>Understanding these core concepts is vital:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Components:</strong> Rendered on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving initial page load performance. Ideal for static content and data fetching.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Components:</strong> Rendered on the client, enabling interactivity and client-side state management. Marked with <code>"use client"</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Nested Layouts:</strong> Define complex UI structures that persist across routes, allowing for shared UI elements without re-rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Fetching:</strong> Simplified data fetching with \`async/await\` directly in Server Components, supporting \`fetch\` and third-party libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Loading UI & Error Boundaries:</strong> Built-in mechanisms for handling loading states and errors gracefully.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Building with the App Router</h2>
      <p>The App Router encourages a new way of thinking about component architecture and data flow. By leveraging Server Components, you can move more rendering and data fetching logic to the server, resulting in faster page loads and a better user experience.</p>
      <p>This paradigm shift makes Next.js an even more powerful tool for building modern, full-stack web applications, especially for SEO-critical sites and complex dashboards.</p>
