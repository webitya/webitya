    content: `
      <p>Python has become a dominant force in web development, thanks to its simplicity, vast ecosystem, and powerful frameworks. Whether you're building a small API or a large-scale enterprise application, Python offers tools to streamline your development process.</p>
      <h2>Popular Python Web Frameworks</h2>
      <p>Choosing the right framework is crucial for your project's success:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level, full-stack framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Ideal for complex, database-driven websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Flask:</strong> A lightweight WSGI web application framework. It's more flexible and allows developers to choose their own tools and libraries. Great for smaller applications and microservices.</li>
        <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's known for its speed and automatic interactive API documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Best Practices for Python Web Development</h2>
      <p>To ensure your Python web applications are robust and maintainable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.</li>
        <li>Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.</li>
        <li>Implement proper error handling and logging.</li>
        <li>Prioritize security measures, including input validation and authentication.</li>
        <li>Utilize asynchronous programming for I/O-bound tasks to improve performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mastering these frameworks and practices will set you on the path to becoming a highly skilled <strong>Python developer</strong> in the web domain.</p>
