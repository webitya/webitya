    content: `
      <p>React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components, allowing us to use state and other React features without writing a class. They promote a more functional and concise way of building UIs.</p>
      <h2>Essential React Hooks</h2>
      <p>Here are the most commonly used Hooks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>useState:</strong> Manages state within functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.</li>
        <li><strong>useEffect:</strong> Handles side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.</li>
        <li><strong>useContext:</strong> Allows you to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting. It simplifies accessing global state.</li>
        <li><strong>useRef:</strong> Provides a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.</li>
        <li><strong>useMemo & useCallback:</strong> Optimization Hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Best Practices for Using Hooks</h2>
      <p>To write efficient and maintainable React code with Hooks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the Rules of Hooks: Only call Hooks at the top level of your React function components.</li>
        <li>Use descriptive names for your state variables.</li>
        <li>Manage side effects carefully with \`useEffect\` dependencies.</li>
        <li>Create custom Hooks to reuse stateful logic across components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Embracing React Hooks is essential for any modern React developer, leading to more readable, testable, and performant applications.</p>
