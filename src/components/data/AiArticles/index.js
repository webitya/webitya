      <h2>AI as a Creative Partner</h2>
      <p>AI is not replacing human creativity but rather augmenting it. It acts as a powerful co-creator, providing artists and designers with new tools, inspirations, and efficiencies. This collaboration allows humans to focus on higher-level conceptualization and refinement, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
      <p>The future of creativity will likely involve a symbiotic relationship between human ingenuity and AI capabilities, leading to unprecedented forms of artistic expression and innovation.</p>
